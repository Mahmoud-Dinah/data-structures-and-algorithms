## Implement a Hashtable Class with the following methods:

add

Arguments: key, value

Returns: nothing

This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.

get

Arguments: key

Returns: Value associated with that key in the table

contains

Arguments: key

Returns: Boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.

hash

Arguments: key

Returns: Index in the collection for that key

---------------------------

## Approach & Efficiency:

Implement a Hashtable with methods:

1) add
2) get
3) contain

------------------------

## BigO:

space :O(1)

Time: O(n)

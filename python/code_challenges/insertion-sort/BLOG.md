## Problem domain:

Create a function called insertionSort that take an array as arg. and sort it ascending

## algorithm:

1- create a function called insertionSort that take an array as argument.

2-create a for loop in range (1, arr length)

3- while loop declare a var named key and equal it to arr[i]

4- while loop declare a var called j and equal it to  i-1

5- create a while loop inside the for loop while j > 0 and key < arr[j]

6- let arr[j+1] =arr[j]

7- j= j-1

8- arr[j+1] = key

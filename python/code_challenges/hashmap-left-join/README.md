## Approach & Efficiency

   - Write a function called left join
  -  Arguments: two hash maps
   - The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.
  -  The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.
    - Return: The returned data structure that holds the results

 ## Big O:
 - time O(n^2)
 - space O(n)
